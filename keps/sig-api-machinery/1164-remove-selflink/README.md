## Release Signoff Checklist

**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an issue in [kubernetes/enhancements] referencing this KEP and targeting a release milestone **before [Enhancement Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases)
of the targeted release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core Kubernetes i.e., [kubernetes/kubernetes], we require the following Release Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.

- [ ] kubernetes/enhancements issue in release milestone, which links to KEP (this should be a link to the KEP location in kubernetes/enhancements, not the initial KEP PR)
- [ ] KEP approvers have set the KEP status to `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place, giving consideration to SIG Architecture and SIG Testing input
- [ ] Graduation criteria is in place
- [ ] "Implementation History" section is up-to-date for milestone
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [kubernetes/website], for publication to [kubernetes.io]
- [ ] Supporting documentation e.g., additional design documents, links to mailing list discussions/SIG meetings, relevant PRs/issues, release notes

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable` or significant changes once it is marked `implementable` should be approved by each of the KEP approvers. If any of those approvers is no longer appropriate than changes to that list should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or SIG-arch for cross cutting KEPs).

**Note:** This checklist is iterative and should be reviewed and updated every time this enhancement is being considered for a milestone.

## Summary

`SelfLink` is a URL representing a given object. It is part of `ObjectMeta` and `ListMeta`
which means that it is part of every single Kubernetes object.

This KEP is proposing deprecating this field and removing it in an year according to our
`Deprecation policy`.

## Motivation

I haven't heard any really compelling reason for having `SelfLink` field. When modifying or
reading an object from kube-apiserver, its `Selflink` is set to exactly the URL that was
used to perform that operation, e.g.
```
apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/deployments/deployment/status
```
So in order to get the object, client has to knew that URL anyway.

What is more, it leaves out exactly the thing that user can't tell from looking at a stored
object, which is what cluster and/or server it came from.

At the same time, setting this `SelfLink` field:
- is treated in a very special way in generic-apiserver - it is the only field that is being
set right before serializing the object (as this is the only place that has all the necessary
information to set it)
- has non-negligible performance impact - constructing the value performs couple memory
allocations (and memory allocations are things that have visible impact on Kubernetes
performance and scalability)

I propose to remove that field after necessary (long enough) deprecation period.

### Goals

- Eliminate performance impact caused by setting `SelfLink`
- Simplify the flow of generic apiserver by eliminating modifying objects late in the
processing path.

### Non-Goals

- Introduce location/source-cluster fields to ObjectMeta or ListMeta objects.

## Proposal

In v1.16, we will deprecate the `SelfLink` field in both `ObjectMeta` and `ListMeta`
objects by:
- documenting in field definition that it is deprecated and is going to be removed
- adding a release-note about field deprecation
We will also introduce a feature gate to allow disabling setting `SelfLink` fields
and opaque the logic setting it behind this feature gate.

In v1.20 (12 months and 4 release from v1.16) we will switch off the feature gate
which will automatically disable setting SelfLinks. However it will still be possible
to revert the behavior by changing value of a feature gate.

In v1.21, we will get rid of the whole code propagating those fields and fields themselves.
In the meantime, we will go over places referencing that field (see below) and get rid
of those too.

### Risks and Mitigations

The risk is that some users may significantly rely on this field in a way we are not aware of.
In that case, we rely on them start shouting loudly and 4 release before fields removal give
us time to revisit that decision.

## Design Details

I went through a k/k repo (including its staging repos) and all repos under [kubernetes-client][]
and this is the list of places that reference `SelfLink` fields (I excluded tests and all places
in apiserver responsible for setting it):

- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/ref/ref.go
  Used for detecting version (which I believe should always be set?).
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubectl/cmd/get/get.go
  Propagating SelfLink in kubectl get.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/config/common.go
  Doesn't seem to be really used anywhere.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/printers/tablegenerator.go
  Setting SelfLink for table format.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/registry/customresource/tableconvertor/tableconvertor.go
  Setting SelfLink in conversion to table format for custom resources.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/registry/rest/table.go
  Setting SelfLink in conversion to table format.
- [ ] staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/reference/ref.go
  A copy of first item literally.

- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/blob/master/kubernetes/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1ListMeta.java
  Setter/getter and part of equals() and hashCode() methods.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/blob/master/kubernetes/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1ObjectMeta.java
  Setter/getter and part of equals() and hashCode() methods.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/csharp/blob/master/src/KubernetesClient/generated/Models/V1ListMeta.cs
  Setter/getter and constructor.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/csharp/blob/master/src/KubernetesClient/generated/Models/V1ObjectMeta.cs
  Setter/getter and constructor.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/go/blob/master/kubernetes/client/v1_list_meta.go
  Only part of type definition.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/go/blob/master/kubernetes/client/v1_object_meta.go
  Only part of type definition.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/ruby/blob/master/kubernetes/lib/kubernetes/models/v1_list_meta.rb

  Setter/getter.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/perl/blob/master/lib/Kubernetes/Object/V1ListMeta.pm
  Seems like setter/getter to me.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/perl/blob/master/lib/Kubernetes/Object/V1ObjectMeta.pm
  Seems like setter/getter to me.
- [ ] https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/client/models/v1_list_meta.py

### Test Plan

No new tests will be created - we expect all the tests to be passing at each phase of deprecation
and after removal of the fields.

### Graduation Criteria

The whole design is about meeting [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy] - this doesn't
require more explanation.

[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

No specific strategy is required.

### Version Skew Strategy

All the references to `SelfLink` should be removed early enough (2 releases before) the field
itself will be removed.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: RemoveSelfLink
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
      - kube-apiserver

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**
  Yes. SelfLink field is no longer propagated by kube-apiserver.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?**
  Yes - selflink is set purely in-memory in kube-apiserver, the feature can be
  switched on and off.

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**
  SelfLink will stop being propagated again.

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
  No.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**
  If there is any component relying on the fact that SelfLink field is set,
  it may stop working as expected.

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**
  No generic metrics. Health of individual components should be watched.
  Generic Kubernetes components has been updated to not rely on it.

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**
  Manual tests were done, SelfLink was/wasn't set as expected.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs,
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**
  Yes - SelfLink field in ObjectMetadata is being deprecated and removed.

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
  SelfLink is not a runtime feature - it's read-only object identifier.

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine
the health of the service?**
  Existing, so-far used metrics to determine components health should be used.

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
  n/a

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability
of this feature?**
  No.

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
  No

### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
provider?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
the existing API objects?**
  No (in fact returned objects will be smaller as they won't contain selflink).

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**
  No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**
  No.

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**
  n/a

* **What are other known failure modes?**
  n/a

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**
  n/a
