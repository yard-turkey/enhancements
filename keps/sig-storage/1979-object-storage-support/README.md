# Summary

This proposal introduces the *Container Object Storage Interface* (COSI), a system composed of Custom Resources (CRs), APIs for bucket provisioning and access, a controller automation architecture, a gRPC specification, and "COSI node adapter" that interfaces with the kubelet on each node. These components combine to support a standard object storage representation in Kubernetes.  

This KEP describes the above components, defines our goals and target use-cases, and sets the scope of the proposal by defining higher level objectives.  The vocabulary section defines terminology.  Relationships between the APIs are provided to illustrate the interconnections between object storage APIs, users' workloads, and object store service instances.  Lastly, the document describes the proposed API specs, the create and delete workflows, and the gRPC spec.

# Motivation

File and block are first class citizens within the Kubernetes ecosystem.  Object, though very different under the hood, is a popular means of storing data, especially against very large data sources.   As such, we feel it is in the interest of the community to integrate object storage into Kubernetes, supported by the SIG-Storage community.  In doing so, we can provide Kubernetes cluster users and administrators a normalized and familiar means of managing object storage. 

While absolute portability cannot be guaranteed because of incompatibilities between object store protocols, workloads reliant on a given protocol (e.g. one of S3, GCS, Azure Blob) may be defined in a manifest and deployed wherever that protocol is supported. When a workload (app pod, deployment, configs) is moved to another cluster which supports the basic infrastructure as the original cluster (e.g. namespaces, bucket classes, provisioners, etc.), then the workload can be moved to a new cluster without requiring any changes in the user manifests.

## User Stories

### Admin

- As a cluster administrator, I can control access to new and existing buckets when accessed from the cluster, regardless of the backing object store.

### User

- As a developer, I can define my object storage needs in the same manifest as my workload, so that deployments are streamlined and encapsulated within the Kubernetes interface.
- As a developer, I can define a manifest containing my workload and object storage configuration once, so that my app may be ported between clusters as long as the storage provided supports my designated data path protocol.
- As a developer, I want to create a workload controller which is bucket API aware, so that it can dynamically connect workloads to underlying object storage.

> Note: this proposal does not include a standardized protocol or abstraction of storage vendor APIs.

## Goals

+ Specify object storage Kubernetes APIs for the purpose of orchestrating/managing object store operations.
+ Implement a Kubernetes controller automation design with support for pluggable provisioners.
+ Support workload portability across clusters.
+ As MVP, be accessible to the largest groups of consumers by supporting the major object storage protocols (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) while being extensible for future protocol additions..
+ Present similar workflows for both greenfield and brownfield bucket operations.

## Non-Goals

+ Defining the _data-plane_ object store interface to replace or supplement existing vendor protcols/APIs is not within scope.
+ Object store deployment/management is left up to individual vendors.
+ Bucket access lifecycle management is not within the scope of this KEP.  ACLs, access policies, and credentialing need to be handled out-of-band.

# Vocabulary

+ _backend bucket_ - any bucket provided by the object store system, completely separate from Kubernetes.
+ _brownfield bucket_ - an existing backend bucket.
+ _Bucket (Bucket Instance)_ - a cluster-scoped custom resource referenced by a `BucketRequest` and containing connection information and metadata for a backend bucket.
+ _BucketAccessRequest (BAR)_ - a user-namespaced custom resource representing a request for access to an existing bucket.
+ _BucketRequest (BR)_ - a user-namespaced custom resource representing a request for a new backend bucket, or access to an existing bucket.
+ _BucketClass (BC)_ - a cluster-scoped custom resource containing fields defining the provisioner and an immutable parameter set for creating new buckets.
+ _BucketAccessClass (BAC)_ - a cluster-scoped custom resource containing fields defining the provisioner and a ConfigMap reference where policy is defined.
+ _COSI_ - Container _Object_ Store Interface, modeled after CSI.
+ _cosi-node-adapter_ - a pod per node which receives Kubelet gRPC _NodePublishVolume_ and _NodeUnpublishVolume_ requests, ensures the target bucket has been provisioned, and notifies the kubelet when the pod can be run.
+ _driver_ - a container (usually paired with a sidecar container) that is responsible for communicating with the underlying object store to create, delete, grant access to, and revoke access from buckets. Drivers talk gRPC and need no knowledge of Kubernetes. Drivers are typically written by storage vendors, and should not be given any access outside of their namespace.
+ _driverless_ - a use-case where no driver exists to support the backend object store. Some COSI automation may still be provided, but backend operations such as creating a bucket or minting credentials will not occur.
+ _greenfield bucket_ - a new backend bucket created by COSI.
+ _green-to-browfield_ - a use-case where COSI creates a new bucket on behalf of a user, and then supports ways for other users in the cluster to share this bucket.
+ _provisioner_ - a generic term meant to describe the combination of a sidecar and driver. "Provisioning" a bucket can mean creating a new bucket or granting access to an existing bucket.
+ _sidecar_ - a Kubernetes-aware container (usually paired with a driver) that is responsible for fullfilling COSI requests with the driver via gRPC calls. The sidecar's access can be restricted to the namespace where it resides, which is expected to be the same namespace as the provisioner. The COSI sidecar is provided by the Kubernetes community.
+ _static provisioning_ - custom resource creation is done by the admin rather than via COSI automation. This may also include _driverless_ but they are independent.

# Proposal

## APIs

### Storage APIs

#### BucketRequest

A user facing, namespaced custom resource requesting provisioning of a new bucket, or requesting access to an existing bucket. A `BucketRequest` (BR) lives in the app's namespace.  In addition to a `BucketRequest`, a [BucketAccessRequest](#bucketaccessrequest) is necessary in order to grant credentials to access the bucket. BRs are required for both greenfield and brownfield uses.

There is a 1:1 mapping of a `BucketRequest` and the cluster scoped `Bucket` instance, meaning there is a single `Bucket` instance for every BR.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketRequest
metadata:
  name:
  namespace:
  labels:
    cosi.io/provisioner: [1]
  finalizers:
    - cosi.io/finalizer [2]
spec:
  protocol: [3]
  bucketPrefix: [4]
  bucketClassName: [5]
  bucketInstanceName: [6]
status:
  bucketAvailable: [7]
```

1. `labels`: added by COSI.  Key’s value should be the provisioner name. Characters that do not adhere to [Kubernetes label conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set) will be converted to ‘-’.
1. `finalizers`: added by COSI to defer `BucketRequest` deletion until backend deletion succeeds.
1. `protocol`: (required) specifies the desired protocol.  One of {“s3”, “gcs”, or “azureBlob”}.
1. `bucketPrefix`: (optional) prefix prepended to a COSI-generated new bucket name, eg. “yosemite-photos-". If `bucketInstanceName` is supplied then `bucketPrefix` is ignored because the request is for access to an existing bucket. If `bucketPrexix` is specified then it is added to the `Bucket` instance as a label.
1. `bucketClassName`: (optional) name of the `BucketClass` used to provision this request. If omitted, a default bucket class matching the protocol is used. If the bucket class does not support the requested protocol, an error is logged and the request is retried. A `BucketClass` is required for both greenfield and brownfield requests since BCs support a list of allowed namespaces.
1. `bucketInstanceName`: (optional) name of the cluster-wide `Bucket` instance. If blank, then COSI assumes this is a greenfield request an will fill in the name during the binding step. If defined by the user, then this names the `Bucket` instance created by the admin. There is no automation available to make this name known to the user.
1. `bucketAvailable`: if true the bucket has been provisioned. If false then the bucket has not been provisioned and is unable to be accessed.

#### Bucket

A cluster-scoped custom resource representing the abstraction of a single backend bucket. A `Bucket` instance stores enough identifying information so that drivers can accurately target the backend object store (e.g. needed during a deletion process).  Many of the associated bucket class fields are copied to the `Bucket`. Additionally, endpoint data returned by the driver is copied to the `Bucket` by the sidecar.

For greenfield, COSI creates the `Bucket` based on values in the `BucketRequest` and `BucketClass`. For brownfield, an admin manually creates the `Bucket` and COSI copies bucket class fields, populates fields returned by the provisioner, and binds the `Bucket` to the `BucketAccess`.

Since there is a 1:1 mapping between a BR and a `Bucket`, when multiple BRs request access to the same backend bucket, each separate `Bucket` points to the same backend bucket.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: [1]
  labels: [2]
    cosi.io/provisioner:
    cosi.io/bucket-prefix:
  finalizers:
    - cosi.io/finalizer [3]
spec:
  provisioner: [4]
  retentionPolicy: [5]
  anonymousAccessMode: [6]
  bucketClassName: [7]
  bucketRequest: [8]
    name:
    namespace:
  allowedNamespaces: [9]
    - name:
  protocol: [10]
    protocolSignature: ""
    azureBlob:
      containerName:
      storageAccount:
    s3:
      version:
      endpoint:
      bucketName:
      region:
      signatureVersion:
    gcs:
      bucketName:
      privateKeyName:
      projectId:
      serviceAccount:
    - name:
  parameters: [11]
status:
  bucketAvailable: [12]
```

1. `name`: When created by COSI, the `Bucket` name is generated in this format: _"<BR.namespace*>-<BR.name*>-<uuid>"_. If an admin creates a `Bucket`, as is necessary for brownfield access, they can use any name. The uuid is unique within a cluster. `*` the first 100 characters of the namespace and the name are used.
    cosi.io/provisioner:
    cosi.io/bucket-prefix:
2. `labels`: added by COSI. The "cosi.io/provisioner" key's value is the provisioner name. The "cosi.io/bucket-prefix" key's value is the `BucketRequest.bucketPrefix` value when specified. Characters that do not adhere to [Kubernetes label conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set) will be converted to ‘-’.
3. `finalizers`: added by COSI to defer `Bucket` deletion until backend deletion ops succeed. Implementation may add one finalizer for the BR and one for the BA.
4. `provisioner`: The provisioner field as defined in the `BucketClass`.  Used by sidecars to filter `Bucket`s. Format: <provisioner-namespace>"/"<provisioner-name>, eg "ceph-rgw-provisoning/ceph-rgw.cosi.ceph.com".
5. `retentionPolicy`: Prescribes the outcome when the `BucketRequest` is deleted.
   - _Retain_: (default) the `Bucket` and its data are preserved. The `Bucket` can potentially be reused.
   - _Delete_: the bucket and its contents are destroyed.
> Note: the `Bucket`'s retention policy is set to "Retain" as a default. Exercise caution when using the "Delete" retention policy as the bucket content will be deleted.
> Note: a `Bucket` is not deleted if it is bound to a `BucketRequest` or `BucketAccess`.
6. `anonymousAccessMode`: a string specifying *uncredentialed* access to the Bucket.  This is applicable to cases where the bucket objects are intended to be publicly readable and/or writable. One of:
   - "private": Default, disallow uncredentialed access to the backend storage.
   - "publicReadOnly": Read only, uncredentialed users can call ListBucket and GetObject.
   - "publicWriteOnly": Write only, uncredentialed users can only call PutObject.
   - "publicReadWrite": Read/Write, same as `ro` with the addition of PutObject being allowed.
> Note: does not reflect or alter the backing storage ACLs or IAM policies.
7. `bucketClassName`: Name of the associated bucket class.
8. `bucketRequest`: Name and namespace of the associated `BucketRequest`.
9. `allowedNamespaces`: a list of namespaces that are permitted to either create new buckets or to access existing buckets.
10. `protocol`: The protocol the application will use to access the backend storage.
   - `protocolSignature`: Specifies the protocol targeted by this Bucket instance.  One of:
     - `azureBlob`: data required to target a provisioned azure container and/or storage account.
     - `s3`: data required to target a provisioned S3 bucket and/or user.
     - `gcs`: data required to target a provisioned GCS bucket and/or service account.
11. `parameters`: a copy of the BucketClass parameters.
12. `bucketAvailable`: if true the bucket has been provisioned. If false then the bucket has not been provisioned and is unable to be accessed.

#### BucketClass

A cluster-scoped custom resource to provide admins control over the handling of bucket provisioning.  The `BucketClass` (BC) defines a retention policy, driver specific parameters, and the provisioner name. A list of allowed namespaces can be specified to restrict new bucket creation and access to existing buckets. A default bucket class can be defined for each supported protocol. This allows the bucket class to be omitted from a `BucketRequest`. All of the `BucketClass` fields are copied to the `Bucket` instance.

> Note: like storage classes, a `BucketClass` is immutable, but a `Bucket` is mutable and contains all of the BC fields.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketClass
metadata:
  name: 
provisioner: [1]
isDefaultBucketClass: [2]
protocol: {"azureblob", "gcs", "s3", ... } [3]
anonymousAccessMode: [4]
retentionPolicy: {"Delete", "Retain"} [5]
allowedNamespaces: [6]
  - name:
parameters: [7]
```

1. `provisioner`: the name of the driver. If supplied the driver container and sidecar container are expected to be deployed. Format: <provisioner-namespace>"/"<provisioner-name>, eg "ceph-rgw-provisoning/ceph-rgw.cosi.ceph.com".
2. `isDefaultBucketClass`: (optional) boolean, default is false. If set to true then a `BucketRequest` may not need to specify a `BucketClass`. If the greenfield `BucketRequest` omits the `BucketClass` and a default `BucketClass`'s protocol matches the `BucketRequest`'s protocol then the default bucket class is used; otherwise an error is logged.
3. `protocol`: (required) protocol supported by the associated object store. This field validates that the `BucketRequest`'s desired protocol is supported.
> Note: if an object store supports more than one protocol then the admin should create a `BucketClass` per protocol.
4. `anonymousAccessMode`: (optional) a string specifying *uncredentialed* access to the backend bucket.  This is applicable for cases where the backend storage is intended to be publicly readable and/or writable. One of:
   - "private": Default, disallow uncredentialed access to the backend storage.
   - "publicReadOnly": Read only, uncredentialed users can call ListBucket and GetObject.
   - "publicWriteOnly": Write only, uncredentialed users can only call PutObject.
   - "publicReadWrite": Read/Write, same as `ro` with the addition of PutObject being allowed.
5. `retentionPolicy`: defines bucket retention for greenfield `BucketRequest`.
   - _Retain_: (default) the `Bucket` instance and the backend bucket are preserved. The `Bucket` may potentially be reused.
   - _Delete_: the backend bucket and the `Bucket` instance are deleted.
> Note: the `Bucket`'s retention policy is set to "Retain" as a default. Exercise caution when using the "Delete" retention policy as the bucket content will be deleted.
> Note: a `Bucket` is not deleted if it is bound to a `BucketRequest` or `BucketAccess`.
6. `allowedNamespaces`: a list of namespaces that are permitted to either create new buckets or to access existing buckets. This list is static for the life of the `BucketClass`, but the `Bucket` instance's list of allowed namespaces can be mutated by the admin.
7. `parameters`: (optional) a map of string:string key values.  Allows admins to set provisioner key-values.  **Note:** see [Provisioner Secrets](#provisioner-secrets) for some predefined `parameters` settings.

### Access APIs

The Access APIs abstract the backend policy system.  Access policy and user identities are an integral part of most object stores.  As such, a system must be implemented to manage both user/credential creation and the binding of those users to individual buckets via policies.  Object stores differ from file and block storage in how they manage users, with cloud providers typically integrating with an IAM platform.  This API includes support for cloud platform identity integration with Kubernetes ServiceAccounts.  On-prem solutions usually provide their own user management systems, which may look very different from each other and from IAM platforms.  We also account for third party authentication solutions that may be integrated with an on-prem service.

#### BucketAccessRequest

A user namespaced custom resource representing an object store user and an access policy defining the user’s relation to that storage.  A user creates a `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) in the app's namespace (which is the same namespace as the `BucketRequest`) A 'BucketAccessRequest' specifies *either* a ServiceAccount or a secret name, and a config map which contains access policy.  Specifying a ServiceAccount enables provisioners to support cloud provider identity integration with their respective Kubernetes offerings.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketAccessRequest
metadata:
  name:
  namespace:
  labels:
    cosi.io/provisioner: [1]
  finalizers:
  - cosi.io/finalizer [2]
spec:
  serviceAccountName: [3]
  accessSecretName: [4]
  bucketRequestName: [5]
  bucketAccessClassName: [6]
  bucketAccessName: [7]
status:
  accessGranted: [8]
```

1. `labels`: added by COSI.  Key’s value should be the provisioner name. Characters that do not adhere to [Kubernetes label conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set) will be converted to ‘-’.
1. `finalizers`: added by COSI to defer `BucketAccessRequest` deletion until backend deletion ops succeed.
1. `serviceAccountName`: (optional) the name of a Kubernetes ServiceAccount in the same namespace.  This field is included to support cloud provider identity integration. When supplied, COSI will call the driver to mint new credentials for this ServiceAccount. `serviceAccountName` should not be set when specifying `accessSecretName`.
1. `accessSecretName`: (optional) the name of a secret in the same namespace.  This field is used when there is no cloud provider identity integration, or the user already has credentials for the backend object store. When supplied, COSI assumes that access is granted to the bucket referenced in the `BucketRequest`, and, thus will not invoke the driver. `accessSecretName` should not be set when specifying `serviceAccountName`.
1. `bucketRequestName`: (required) the name of the `BucketRequest` associated with this access request. From the bucket request, COSI knows the `Bucket` instance and thus the backend bucket and its properties.
1. `bucketAccessClassName`: (required) name of the `BucketAccessClass` specifying the desired set of policy actions to be set for a user identity or ServiceAccount.
1. `bucketAccessName`: name of the bound cluster-scoped `BucketAccess` instance. Set by COSI.
1. `accessGranted`: if true access has been granted to the bucket. If false then access to the bucket has not been granted.

#### BucketAccess

A cluster-scoped administrative custom resource which encapsulates fields from the `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) and the `BucketAccessClass` (BAC).  The purpose of the `BucketAccess` (BA) is to serve as an access communication path between provisioners and the central COSI controller.  The COSI controller creates a `BucketAccess` instance for a new `BucketAccessRequest`, and there is a 1:1 mapping between `BucketAccess` and `BucketAccessRequest`.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketAccess
metadata: 
  name: [1]
  labels:
    cosi.io/provisioner: [2]
  finalizers:
  - cosi.io/finalizer [3]
 spec:
  provisioner: [4]
  bucketInstanceName: [5]
  bucketAccessRequest: [6]
    name:
    namespace:
  serviceAccount: [7]
    name:
    namespace:
  mintedSecretName: [8]
  policyActionsConfigMapData: [9]
  principal: [10]
  parameters: [11]
 status:
   accessGranted: [12]
```

1. `name`: the BA name is generated by COSI in this format: _"<BAR.namespace*>-<BAR.name*>-<uuid>"_. The uuid is unique within a cluster. `*` the first 100 characters of the namespace and the name are used.
1. `labels`: added COSI.  Key’s value should be the provisioner name. Characters that do not adhere to [Kubernetes label conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set) will be converted to ‘-’.
1. `finalizers`: added by COSI to defer `BucketAccess` deletion until the pod that uses this access terminates, and the related `BucketAccessRequest` is deleted.
1. `provisioner`:  name of the provisioner that should handle this `BucketAccess` instance.  Copied from the `BucketAccessClass`.
1. `bucketInstanceName`:  name of the `Bucket` instance bound to this BA.
1. `bucketAccessRequest`: name and namespace of the bound `BucketAccessRequest`.
1. `serviceAccount`: name and namespace of the Kubernetes ServiceAccount, if any, specified by the `BucketAccessRequest`.  Empty when the `BucketAccessRequest.mintedSecretName` was specified.
1. `mintedSecretName`: name of the provisioner-generated Secret containing access credentials. This Secret exists in the provisioner’s namespace and must be copied to the app namespace by the COSI controller. **Note:** the provisioner's namespace is contained in the registered driver name.
1. `policyActionsConfigMapData`: encoded data that contains a set of provisioner/platform defined policy actions to a given user identity. Contents of the ConfigMap that the *policyActionsConfigMap* field in the `BucketAccessClass` refers to.
1. `principal`: username/access-key for the object storage provider to uniquely identify the user who has access to this bucket  
1. `parameters`:  A map of string:string key values.  Allows admins to control user and access provisioning by setting provisioner key-values. Copied from `BucketAccessClass`. 
1. `accessGranted`: if true access has been granted to the bucket. If false then access to the bucket has not been granted.

#### BucketAccessClass

A cluster-scoped custom resource providing a way for admins to specify policies that may be used to access buckets. A `BucketAccessClass` (BAC) is required for both greenfield and brownfield use cases. Besides naming the provisioner, a BAC references a config map which is expected to define the access policy for a given provider. It is typical for these config maps to reside in each provisioner's namespace, though this is not required.  Unlike BucketClasses, there is no default BAC.

```yaml
apiVersion: cosi.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketAccessClass
metadata: 
  name:
provisioner: [1]
policyActionsConfigMap: [2]
  name:
  namespace:
parameters: [3]
```

1. `provisioner`: (required) the name of the driver that `BucketAccess` instances should be managed by. Format: <provisioner-namespace>"/"<provisioner-name>, eg "ceph-rgw-provisoning/ceph-rgw.cosi.ceph.com".
1. `policyActionsConfigMap`: (required) a reference to a ConfigMap that contains a set of provisioner/platform defined policy actions for a given user identity.
1. `parameters`: (Optional)  A map of string:string key values.  Allows admins to control user and access provisioning by setting provisioner key-values. Optional reserved keys cosi.io/configMap and cosi.io/secrets are used to reference user created resources with provider specific access policies.
---

### App Pod
The application pod utilizes CSI's inline empheral volume support to provide the endpoint and secret credentials in an in-memory volume. This approach also, importantly, prevents the pod from launching before the bucket has been provisioned since the kubelet waits to start the pod until it has received the cosi-node-adapter's _NodePublishVolume_ response.

Here is a sample pod manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
  namespace: dev-ns
spec:
  serviceAccountName: [1]
  containers:
    - name: my-app
      image: ...
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cosi [2]
          name: cosi-vol
  volumes:
    - name: cosi-vol
      csi: [3]
        driver: cosi.sigs.k8s.io [4]
        volumeAttributes: [5]
          bucketAccessRequestName: <my-bar-name>
```
1. the service account may be needed depending on cloud IAM integration with kubernetes.
1. the mount path is the directory where the app will read the credentials and endpoint.
1. this is an inline CSI volume.
1. the name of the cosi-node-adapter.
1. information needed by the cosi-node-adapter to verify that the bucket has been provisioned.

> Note: `VolumeLifeCycleModes` needs to be set to "empheral" for inline COSI node adapter.

### Topology

![Architecture Diagram](images/arch.png)

# Object Relationships

The diagram below describes the relationships between various resources in the COSI ecosystem. 

![Object Relationships](images/object-rel.png)

# Workflows
Here we describe the workflows used to automate provisioning of new and existing buckets, and the de-provisioning of these buckets.

> Note: when the app pod is started, the kubelet will gRPC call _NodePublishVolume_ which is received by the cosi-node-adapter. The pod waits until the adapter responds to the gRPC request. The adapter ensures that the target bucket has been provisioned and is ready to be accessed.  When the app pod terminates, the kubelet gRPC calls _NodeUnpublishVolume_ which the cosi-node-adapter also receives. The adapter orchestrates tear-down of bucket access resources, but does not delete the `BucketRequest` nor `Bucket` instances.

General prep:
+ admin creates the needed bucket classes and bucket access classes.

Prep for brownfield:
+ admin creates `Bucket` instances representing backend buckets.

## Create Bucket

![CreateBucket Workflow](images/create-bucket.png)

This workflow describes the automation supporting creating a new (greenfield) backend bucket. Accessing this bucket is covered in [Sharing COSI Created Buckets](#sharing-cosi-created-buckets).

> Note: COSI determines that a request is for an existing bucket when `BucketRequest.bucketInstanceName` is specified. How the user knows the `Bucket` instance name is not defined by COSI.

Here is the workflow:

+ COSI central controller sees a new `BucketRequest` (BR).
+ COSI gets the `BR.BucketClass` (directly or via the matching default) and verifies that the BR's namespace is allowed.
+ If BR.bucketInstanceName is empty, COSI creates the associated `Bucket`, filling in fields from the `BucketClass` and BR. Else, we have a brownfield BR.
+ The sidecar sees the new `Bucket` and gRPC calls the driver to create a backend bucket.
+ COSI updates the BR and `Bucket` instance to reference each other.

In addition, the cosi-node-adapter sees a new app pod references a BAR:
+ cosi-node-adapter receives _NodePublishVolume_ request from kubelet.
+ adapter add a finalizer to both the BAR.BA and the BAR.BR.
+ the finalizer value is `pod.name`

## Sharing COSI Created Buckets
This is the greenfield -> brownfield access use case, where COSI has created the `Bucket` instance and the driver has provisioned a new bucket. Now, we want to share access to this bucket in other namespaces.

![ShareBucket Workflow](images/share-bucket.png)

> Note: if the bucket sharing is all within the same namespace then each `BucketAccessRequest` (also in that namespace) only needs to reference the existing BR.

Here is the workflow:

+ A `Bucket` instance created by COSI must be cloned by the admin (each `Bucket` instance needs a unique name).
+ The user creates a `BucketRequest` (BR) that specifies the `Bucket` instance name (BR.bucketInstanceName) provided by the admin.
+ The user creates a `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) - see [grant bucket access](#grant-bucket-access) -- and the BAR references their BR.

## Delete Bucket

![DeleteBucket Workflow](images/delete-bucket.png)

This workflow describes the automation designed for deleting a `Bucket` instance and optionally the related backend bucket. Revoking access to this bucket is covered in [Revoke Bucket Access](#revoke-bucket-access).

> Note: it is important to understand that when a `BucketRequest` deletion triggers the delete of the associated `Bucket` instance, the `Bucket` instance is deleted regardless of access. This means that even if a `BucketAccess` references a `Bucket`, the `Bucket is still deleted and the BA is orphaned. Additionally, even if multiple `Bucket` instances point to the same backend bucket, if the retention policy is "Delete" then the bucket is deleted and workloads may fail. Potentially, this may only apply to MVP.
A `BucketAccess` instance is deleted only once the underlying Pod stop using the access credentials. `BucketAccess` instance is deleted by deleting the corresponding BAR or admin can delete the BA directly. If a Pod is using the BA then the BA deletion will wait until Pod is deleted. If a Pod using the BA is terminated, then the BA can be deleted by deleting the BAR. 

> Note: it's up to each provisioner whether or not to physically delete bucket content. But, for idempotency, the expectation is that the backend bucket will at least be made unavailable, pending out-of-band bucket lifecycle policies.

> Note: delete is described below as a synchronous workflow but it will likely need to be implemented asynchronously to accommodate potentially long delete times when buckets contain many objects. The steps should still mostly follow what's outlined below.

Here is the workflow:

+ User deletes their `BucketRequest` (BR) which is deferred until finalizers have been removed.
+ COSI gets the `Bucket` instance from the BR and notes the retention policy.
+ If the `Bucket` instance was created by COSI then COSI deletes the `Bucket`, which sets its deleteTimestamp but does not delete it due to finalizer.
+ If the `Bucket` instance was not created by COSI then the `Bucket` is not deleted, but finalizers are removed so that the admin can manually delete it.
+ COSI unbinds the BR from the `Bucket`.
+ Sidecar sees the `Bucket` is unbound, and if the retention policy is "Delete", the gRPC calls the provisoner's _Delete_ interface. Upon successful completion, the `Bucket` is updated to Deleted.
+ If the retention policy is "Retain" then the `Bucket` remains "Released" and it can potentially be reused.
+ When COSI sees the `Bucket` is "Deleted", it removes all finalizers and the resources are garbage collected.

## Grant Bucket Access
This workflow describes the automation supporting granting access to an existing backend bucket.

Here is the workflow:

+ The admin creates a cluster-scoped `Bucket` representing the backend bucket.
+ The user creates a `BucketRequest` referencing this `Bucket` instance and COSI follows the "Create Bucket" workflow.
+ The user creates a `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) which references their BR.
+ COSI central controller sees a new `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) and gets the `BAR.BucketAccessClass` (BAC).
+ COSI creates the cluster-scoped `BucketAccess` (BA) filling in the field from the BAR and BAC.
+ The sidecar sees the new BA and gRPC calls the driver to grant access to the backend bucket.
+ COSI updates the BAR and BA to reference each other.
+ The cosi-node-adapter, which has been waiting for the BAR to be processed, writes access tokens to the app pod's specified mount point.

## Revoke Bucket Access
This workflow describes the automation supporting revoking access to an existing backend bucket, and the deletion of the cluster-scoped `BucketAccess` instance.

Here is the workflow:

+ COSI central controller sees the `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) has been deleted.
+ COSI gets the `BAR.BucketAccess` (BA).
+ COSI deletes the BA, but finalizers prevent it from being garbage collected.
+ The sidecar sees the BA has been deleted and gRPC calls the driver to revoke access to the backend bucket.
+ COSI removes the BAR and BA finalizers and these instances are garbage collected.

In addition, the cosi-node-adapter sees the app pod is terminating:
+ cosi-node-adapter receives _NodeUnPublishVolume_ request from kubelet.
+ adapter removes its finalizer from both the BAR.BA and the BAR.BR.

## Delete BucketAccess 
The above workflows are triggered by the user. Now we cover worflows triggerd by the admin.
The most common scenario is likely the case where tokens are compromised and the admin needs to stop their use. In this case the admin may terminate the app pod(s) and delete the `BucketAccess` instances.

Here is the workflow:

+ Admin deletes a `BucketAccess` (BA) which is deferred until the finalizer has been removed.
+ The sidecar detects the delete and calls the driver to revoke access to the backend bucket.
+ Admin deletes the app pod.
+ The cosi-node-adapter is notified (_NodeUnpublishVolume_) and removes the pod.name finalizer from the BA, and the BA is garbage collected.
+ The user BAR remains pointing to a BA that no longer exists. It is felt that COSI should not delete user-created instances.:w

##  Setting Access Permissions
### Dynamic Provisioning
Incoming `BucketAccessRequest`s either contain a *serviceAccountName* where a cloud provider supports identity integration, or an *accessSecretName*. In both cases, the incoming `BucketAccessRequest` represents a user to access the `Bucket`.
When requesting access to a bucket, workloads will go through the scenarios described here:
+  New User: In this scenario, we do not have user account in the backend storage system as well as no access for this user to the `Bucket`. 
	+ Create user account in the backend storage system.
	+ add the access privileges for the user to the `Bucket`.
	+ return the credentials to the workload owning the `BucketAccessRequest`.
+  Existing User and New Bucket: In this scenario, we have the user account created in the backend storage system, but the account is not associated to the `Bucket`.
	+ add the access privileges to the `Bucket`.
	+ return the credentials to the workload owning the `BucketAccessRequest`.
+  Existing User and existing Bucket: In this scenario, the user account has access policy defined on the `Bucket`.  The existing user privileges in the backend may conflict with the privileges that the user is requesting.
	+ FAIL, if existing access policy is different from the requested policy.
	+ if the existing privileges match the requested privileges, return the credentials to the workload owning the `BucketAccessRequest`.
+ A Service Account specified and the cloud platform identity integration maps Kubernetes ServiceAccounts to the account in the backend storage system. No need to create credentials here.
	
Upon success, the `BucketAccess` instance is ready and the app workload can access backend storage.

### Static Provisioning
"Driverless" allows the existing workloads to make use of COSI without the need for vendors to create drivers. The following steps show the details of the workflow:
+ Admin creates `Bucket` instance that references an existing backend bucket.
+ User creates a `BucketRequest` (BR) that references this `Bucket`.
+ User creates `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) that references their BR, a `BucketAccessClass`, and their secret containing access tokens.
+ COSI detects the existence of the BAR and follows the [grant access](#grant-bucket-access) steps.
+ COSI detects the existence of the BAR, BA and executes a validation process.
+ As a validation step, COSI ensures that the `BucketRequest.bucketInstanceName` matches the `BucketAccessRequest.bucketAccessName.bucketInstanceName`. In other words, the two related `Bucket` references match, meaning that the BR and BAR->BA point to the same `Bucket`.

# Provisioner Secrets

Per [Non-Goals](#non-goals), it is not within the scope of the proposal to abstract IAM operations.  Instead, provisioner and user credentials should be provided to automation by admins or users.  
To allow for flexibility in authorizing provisioner operations, credentials may be provided to the provisioner in several ways.

- **Per Provisioner:** the Secret is used for all provisioning operations, for the lifetime of the provisioner.  These Secrets should be injected directly into the provisioner's container via [common Kubernetes patterns](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/).

Credentials may also be specified at more granular levels in order to allow for context dependent keys.  E.g. When authorization differs between BucketClasses or between individual operations.  This may be facilitated by defining a set of string keys which the core automation will be aware of, so that Secrets may be referenced by BucketClasses.  For example:

```
cosi.io/provisioner-secret-name:
cosi.io/provisioner-secret-namespace:
```

- **Per BucketClass:** A secret may be made specific to a BucketClass.  This suits cases where authorization may be segregated in the object store.  The Secret may then be defined explicitly in the `bucketClass.parameters` map.

  ```
  cosi.io/provisioner-secret-name: "foo"
  cosi.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: "bar"
  ```

- **Per Operation/Bucket:** Unique credentials are passed per Bucket or operation. In order to support dynamic Secret naming, templating similar to [CSI Secret templating](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/secrets-and-credentials-storage-class.html) may be used.  E.g.

  ```
  "${bucket.name}"
  "${bucket.namespace}"
  ```
  
  Admins may then define a BucketClass with the following parameters included:

  *Per Bucket Operation*
  
  ```
  cosi.io/provisioner-secret-name: "${bucket.name}"
  cosi.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: "${bucket.namespace}"
  ```
---

# gRPC Definitions

There is one service defined by COSI - `Provisioner`. This will need to be satisfied by the vendor-provisioner in order to be COSI-compatible

```
service Provisioner {
    rpc ProvisionerGetInfo (ProvisionerGetInfoRequest) returns (ProvisionerGetInfoResponse) {}

    rpc ProvisionerCreateBucket (ProvisionerCreateBucketRequest) returns (ProvisionerCreateBucketResponse) {}
    rpc ProvisionerDeleteBucket (ProvisionerDeleteBucketRequest) returns (ProvisionerDeleteBucketResponse) {}

    rpc ProvisionerGrantBucketAccess (ProvisionerGrantBucketAccessRequest) returns (ProvisionerGrantBucketAccessResponse);
    rpc ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccess (ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccessRequest) returns (ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccessResponse);
}
```

## ProvisionerGetInfo

This call is meant to retrieve the unique provisioner Identity. This identity will have to be set in `BucketRequest.Provisioner` field in order to invoke this specific provisioner.

```
message ProvisionerGetInfoRequest {
    // Intentionally left blank
}

message ProvisionerGetInfoResponse {    
    string provisioner_identity = 1;
}
```

## ProvisonerCreateBucket

This call is made to create the bucket in the backend. If the bucket already exists, then the appropriate error code `ALREADY_EXISTS` must be returned by the provisioner.

```
message ProvisionerCreateBucketRequest {    
    // This field is REQUIRED
    string bucket_name = 1;

    map<string,string> bucket_context = 2;

    enum AnonymousBucketAccessMode {
	PRIVATE = 0;
	PUBLIC_READ_ONLY = 1;
	PUBLIC_WRITE_ONLY = 2;
	PUBLIC_READ_WRITE = 3;
    }
    
    AnonymousBucketAccessMode anonymous_bucket_access_mode = 3;
}

message ProvisionerCreateBucketResponse {
    // Intentionally left blank
}
```

## ProvisonerDeleteBucket

This call is made to delete the bucket in the backend. If the bucket has already been deleted, then no error should be returned.

```
message ProvisionerDeleteBucketRequest {
    // This field is REQUIRED
    string bucket_name = 1;
    
    map<string,string> bucket_context = 2;    
}

message ProvisionerDeleteBucketResponse {
     // Intentionally left blank
}
```

## ProvisionerGrantBucketAccess

This call grants access to a particular principal. Note that the principal is the account for which this access should be granted. 

If the principal is set, then it should be used as the username of the created credentials or in some way should be deterministically used to generate a new credential for this request. This principal will be used as the unique identifier for deleting this access by calling ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccess

If the `principal` is empty, then a new service account should be created in the backend that satisfies the requested `access_policy`. The username/principal for this service account should be set in the `principal` field of `ProvisionerGrantBucketAccessResponse`.

```
message ProvisionerGrantBucketAccessRequest {
    // This field is REQUIRED
    string bucket_name = 1;
    
    map<string,string> bucket_context = 2;  

    string principal = 3;
    
    // This field is REQUIRED
    string access_policy = 4;
}

message ProvisionerGrantBucketAccessResponse {
    // This is the account that is being provided access. This will
    // be required later to revoke access. 
    string principal = 1;
    
    string credentials_file_contents = 2;
    
    string credentials_file_path = 3;
} 
```

## ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccess

This call revokes all access to a particular bucket from a principal.  

```
message ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccessRequest {
    // This field is REQUIRED
    string bucket_name = 1;
    
    map<string,string> bucket_context = 2;  

    // This field is REQUIRED
    string principal = 3;
}

message ProvisionerRevokeBucketAccessResponse {
    // Intentionally left blank
}
```

# Test Plan

- Unit tests will cover the functionality of the controllers.
- Unit tests will cover the new APIs.
- An end-to-end test suite will cover testing all the components together.
- Component tests will cover testing each controller in a blackbox fashion.
- Tests need to cover both correctly and incorrectly configured cases.


# Graduation Criteria

## Alpha

- API is reviewed and accepted
- Implement all COSI components to support Greenfield, Green/Brown Field, Brownfield and Static Driverless provisioning
- Evaluate gaps, update KEP and conduct reviews for all design changes 
- Develop unit test cases to demonstrate that the above mentioned use cases work correctly


# Alternatives Considered
This KEP has had a long journey and many revisions. Here we capture the main alternatives and the reasons why we decided on a different solution.

## Add Bucket Instance Name to BucketAccessClass (brownfield)

### Motivation
1. To improve workload _portability_ user namespace resources should not reference non-deterministic generated names. If a `BucketAccessRequest` (BAR) references a `Bucket` instance's name, and that name is pseudo random (eg. a UID added to the name) then the BAR, and hence the workload deployment, is not portable to another cluser.

1. If the `Bucket` instance name is in the BAC instead of the BAR then the user is not burdened with knowledge of `Bucket` names, and there is some centralized admin control over brownfield bucket access.

### Problems
1. The greenfield -> brownfield workflow is very awkward with this approach. The user creates a `BucketRequest` (BR) to provision a new bucket which they then want to access. The user creates a BAR pointing to a BAC which must contain the name of this newly created ``Bucket` instance. Since the `Bucket`'s name is non-deterministic the admin cannot create the BAC in advance. Instead, the user must ask the admin to find the new `Bucket` instance and add its name to new (or maybe existing) BAC.

1. App portability is still a concern but we believe that deterministic, unique `Bucket` and `BucketAccess` names can be generated and referenced in BRs and BARs.

1. Since, presumably, all or most BACs will be known to users, there is no real "control" offered to the admin with this approach. Instead, adding _allowedNamespaces_ or similar to the BAC may help with this.
